	This file demonstrates different ways of data presentation
	The input data are defined by the file "exp/readme".

!  No equation for NE is given. Therefore, NE coincides with NEX at t=t_0 by default. 
!  However, after TIME=0.5s they diverge.

!  TE follows the evolution of TEX according to specification ASsign.
TE:AS;		TE=TEX;

!  Arrays CAR1 and CAR1X are always different.

CU:AS;	MU=.2*FPR+.185;		CC=CCSP;	CAR1=(FP-FPC)/(FPB-FPC);

!  The arrays CAR2X, CAR3X, CAR4X represent the same parabolic profile
!  along a sweeping chord, horizontal chord and vertical chord, respectively.
!  Note that small truncation errors in the input data cause large extrapolation
!       errors when the chord is far remoted from a magnetic axis  

Profile output

Here the curve TEX and the set of data TEX are combined (both in red). 
Calculated quantity TE (No.9) is drawn in the same box in blue.
