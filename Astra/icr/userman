*           INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE RAYIC CODE                 *
*                                                                      *
************************************************************************
*
*     The ray tracing code RAYIC has been written for the
*     evaluation of the power deposition profiles during
*     Ion Cyclotron Heating in large Tokamak plasmas. The
*     main method is ray-tracing, supplemented by a 3-D
*     analysis of the singular layers (ion cyclotron and
*     Two-Ion Hybrid resonances), and a 3-D plane-layered
*     model of the antenna.
*
*     The plasma poloidal cross-section can have arbitrary
*     shape. The poloidal magnetic field distribution is
*     evaluated from the current density profile consistently
*     with the MHD equilibrium equations.
*
*     The hot-plasma dispersion relation correct to first
*     order in the Finite Larmor Radius approximation is
*     used, with electrons and up to eight ion species, each
*     with its own density and temperature profile. To
*     allow coupling RAYIC to transport codes, the profile
*     quantities have to be specified at discrete mesh points,
*     and cubic spline interpolation is used to guarantee
*     a smooth integration of the ray equations.
*
*     The call to the ray-tracing program is a call to the
*     subroutine RAYIC:
*
*           CALL RAYIC
*
*     In the standard version the USER is PROGRAM MAIN. It is
*     hovever possible to call RAYIC from any other program,
*     with a simple interface to provide the necessary data
*     to RAYIC. To this end, the USER code must include the
*     labelled COMMONs
*
*          /CPLDIM/,   /CPLPAR/,   /CPROIC/,
*          /CPOWIC/,   /CANTIC/,   /CPRTIC/,
*          /OUTPIC/
*
*     and must initialize their variables as indicated in the
*     segment COMINDEX. No dataset (NAMELIST, etc.) is required.
*
*     At the RETURN from RAYIC the USER program has available
*     (through the above labeled COMMONS) the power deposition
*     profiles for each species of charged particle. The
*     values of the input variables are returned unaltered.
*
*     In addition, the USER package must include the function
*     defining the initial wavefront:
*
*                 Function   PSIWFR(THETA,ZDPSDT)
*
*     and the two functions providing the poloidal (y) and
*     toroidal (z) Fourier spectra of the current distribution
*     in the antennas:
*
*                 Function CFUNJY(ZNY)
*                 Function CFUNJZ(NPH)
*
*     A description of these modules is found at the end of
*     this manual. The standard MAIN is provided with versions
*     of CFUNJY and CFUNJZ capable of dealing with dipole and
*     quadrupole antennas, either with equatorial feeders and
*     up-down shorts, or viceversa (options through JPOLE and
*     JALIM parameters, cfr. instructions in segment COMINDEX).
*
*     RAYIC contains the only STOP of the Ray Tracing package:
*     the program is stopped if the input data are inconsistent.
*     In this case a diagnostic is printed.

*=======================================================================
*
*     RAYIC consists of three essentially independent packages:
*
*        A) the ray-tracing package proper,
*        B) the antenna package,
*        C) the package providing the graphical output.
*
*     An alphabetic list of all subroutines of RAYIC, with a
*     brief description and all cross-calls is to be found in
*     in the segment SUBINDEX.
*
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*     A) The ray-tracing package is steered by the control
*     subroutine RAYIC, and can be subdivided into the
*     following sections:
*
*        a) the initialization section, which is steered by
*           subroutine INITAL, and includes the subroutines
*              INITAL,    PROFIN,    INIWFR,    METRIN,
*              CYTWIN
*           In addition, ANTIC and its package logocally
*           belong to this section.
*
*        b) The section implementing ray tracing, steered by
*           subroutine RAYPAT, and including the subroutines
*              RAYPAT,    PROFIX,    DERHIC,    DISPIC,
*              COORDS,    WAVECT,    INVERT,    PROFIX,
*              ZETA,      IBESSN,    ABSORB
*
*        c) The section dealing with singularities (cyclo-
*           tron and ion-ion hybrid resonances), i.e. the
*           subroutines
*              CYCRES,    TIHRES,    INTHRM
*
*        d) The output subroutines
*              OUTRUN,    OUTPUT
*           In addition, the graphical output subroutine OUTGRA
*           and its package also belong to this group.
*
*        e) The 'cubic spline interpolation' subroutines
*                CUBSPL,    VALSPL
*
*        f) The predictor-corrector subroutine
*                HPCSD
*
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*     B) the antenna package, steered by subroutine ANTIC,
*     includes the subroutines
*
*              ANTIC,     INIANT,    CYSFIC,    OUTANT,
*              FUANTY,    ZBFAC2,    POYNTX
*
*     It is completely modular, since only ANTIC is called
*     by RAYIC; the other subroutines are private of ANTIC.
*     Thus the evaluation of the antenna could be easily
*     modified if the present model were found inadequate.
*     ANTIC provides the RAYIC package with the power spectre
*     of the antenna over toroidal modes, and the poloidal
*     distribution of power flux for each mode. These quan-
*     tities are transmitted to RAYIC through labelled COMMONs,
*     just as any other input run parameter (Cfr. COMINDEX).
*
*     With the option 'NANTS = 0', the call to ANTIC is
*     skipped, and the antenna is initialised by INITAL
*     with a (sin(Nphi*D)/Nphi)**2 toroidal spectre, and a
*     (sin(z*h)/z)**2 poloidal distribution of the power flux
*     (D = width, h = heigth of the antenna element). This
*     occurs if ANTIC detects a resonance in the near-field
*     region and is therefore obliged to stop.
*
*     With the option JOUTA=-1 it is possible to run the
*     ANTIC package alone (without Ray Tracing).
*
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*     C) The graphical output consists of the subroutines
*
*              OUTGRA,    GERGRA,    GRAPHS,    PLOPSI
*
*     It is also modular, since only the steering subroutine
*     OUTGRA is called by RAYIC. This should simplify
*     rewriting the plot package if the code is to be used
*     at installations with different plotting facilities.
*
*     Subroutines GERGRA, GRAPHS and PLOTPSI contain calls
*     to plotting subroutines of a plot library available
*     at IPP-Garching. Normally, only these calls need to be
*     modidied to adapt this package to other installations.

*          User-defined functions required by the RAYIC code           *
*                                                                      *

*
*           FUNCTION PSIWFR(THETA,ZDPSDT)
*
*     This function specifies the equation of the initial wave-
*     front, psi = psi(theta).
*     The input argument is THETA (real, poloidal angle in rad.).
*     The return arguments are
*
*            PSIWFR = psi(theta)
*
*     (real, flux variable psi normalized between 0 on the
*     magnetic axis and 1 at the plasma edge), and the deri-
*     vative ZDPSDT (real):
*
*            ZDPSDT = d(psi)/d(theta)
*
*     The name PSIWFR cannot be altered.
*
*=======================================================================
*
*           FUNCTION CFUNJY(ZNY)
*
*     This complex function must provide the y complex Fourier
*     transform of the current distribution along each element of
*     the antenna, as function of the poloidal wavenumber Ny.
*     It is not necessary to normalize the Fourier transform.
*
*     Input argument is ZNY (real), the poloidal wave index
*     (c*ky/omega).
*     The output is the Fourier component CFUNJY, which must be
*     declared as COMPLEX.
*
*     The evaluation of CFUNJY usually requires the parameters of
*     of the input-output COMMONs.
*
*=======================================================================
*
*           FUNCTION CFUNJZ(NPH)
*
*     This complex function must provide the z complex Fourier
*     transform of the poloidal current distribution in each
*     antenna element (all elements identical), as function of
*     the toroidal wavenumber Nphi. It is not necessary to
*     normalize the Fourier transform.
*
*     Input argument is NPH (integer), the toroidal wavenumber.
*     The output is the complex Fourier component CFUNJZ, which
*     must be declared as complex.
*
*     The evaluation of CFUNJZ usually requires the parameters of
*     of the input-output COMMONs.
