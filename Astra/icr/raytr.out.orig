                         TOTAL POWER BALANCE
          Launched power             =   1.0000E+00 MW
          Absorbed by the plasma     =   2.5841E-01 MW
          Absorbed near the antenna  =   0.0000E+00 MW
          Non absorbed               =   7.4159E-01 MW

          Power to the electrons    =   9.3404E-03 MW     (      3.61 %)
          Power to Bernst. waves    =   6.7257E-03 MW     (*     2.60 %)
                  to species      1 =    2.748E-02 MW     (     10.64 %)
                  to species      2 =    2.216E-01 MW     (     85.75 %)

 *: The power to IB waves is also attributed to electrons and ions
    depending on the local absorption rates.
