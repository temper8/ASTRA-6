C NUFE [1/s]:	Slowing down frequency for fast ions
C		fast_ion -> electron collision frequency
C	
C The following quantities are not defined in versions > 5.3
C   ZBEAM      Beam ion charge in the proton charge units
C   ABEAM      Beam ion mass in the proton mass units
	ZBEAM = 1.
	ABEAM = 2.
	include	'fml/coulg'
	NUFE = .51*ZBEAM**2*COULG*NE(J)*sqrt(ABEAM/TE(j))/(ABEAM*TE(j))
