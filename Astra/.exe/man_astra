     Astra - execute the Astra code
 
SYNOPSIS
     Astra [-h] [-b] [-t] [-T] [-V] [-M] 
           [-v exp_data_file] [-m model_file] [-s start_time]
           [-p pause_time] [-e stop_time] [-r result_file]
     Astra exp_data_file model_file start_time stop_time result_file_name

DESCRIPTION
      Astra (aliased to AWD/.exe/astra) defines input parameter set 
      and starts ASTRA run.

      Input set of parameters includes: 
      - a filename with initial and/or experimental data,
      - a filename for a transport code prototype (model).
      These two filenames should not exceed 14 characters. 
      Optionally, start and stop times of a simulation run and 
      a filename for storing simulation results can be given.
      
 OPTIONS
      -h     display this page and exit.
  
      -b     start the code in background.
  
      -t     start the code in "test" mode.
  
      -T     start the code in "verbose test" mode.
  
      -V     list all available data files.
  
      -M     list all available model files.
  
      -v exp_data_file_name
           read input data from exp/'exp_data_file_name'. If a data 
           filename is not defined in the command line then the data
           file used in the previous Astra run is employed.
  
      -m model_file_name
           use the transport model equ/'file_name'. If a model file
           name is not defined in the command line then the model file
           used in the previous Astra run is employed.
  
      -r result_file_name
           save the simulation results under 'result_file_name'. 
           A valid filename can include up to 20 characters.
  
      -s value
           start the simulation at time = 'value'. Unlike the ealier
           versions (before 5.2) if the initial time is not given
           in the command line (and not assigned by a data file) it is 
           set to 0.
 
      -p value
           set pause mode at time = 'value'. Default value is infinity.
  
      -e value
           stop the run at time = 'value'. Default value is infinity.
  
 USAGE
     Astra command line allows two different formats: in the older one a
     positional argument list is only possible. In this format, a meaning 
     of every argument is determined by its position in the command line. 
     In the second format, meaning of a parameter can also be defined
     by a preceeding option letter. Mixture of both formats is possible 
     under conditions that (i) only the options which do not require an 
     argument (i.e. h t V M) are used and (ii) all option letters must 
     appear in the command line before the first positional parameter. 
     A value of any parameter in the command line can be omitted, 
     in the positional format, it means be replaced with a comma.
     Then for the data and model file the previously defined names 
     are used. For remaining parameters default values are used.
